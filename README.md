# SkriptGPS

### Setup
- Clone the GitHub repository
- Place the GPS Plugin from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/gps-1-9-1-20-global-positioning-system-for-your-server.53672/) into ``libs/``*
- Make sure the jar file is named ``GPS.jar`` and reload gradle.
- You can now build the plugin.

`*` As the plugin is a paid resource I can't provide it on github.

### Effects:
Start GPS - ``start gps for %player% to %string%``

Stop GPS - ``stop gps for %player%``

### Conditions:
Check for GPS - ``%player% has [active] gps``
